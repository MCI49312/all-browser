#But what will the 'retire' affect?

This will affect that the browsers will be:
'not secure, outdated, update-ready, attackable'

2025 January - planned update to Update3 - tag: 3.0
2025 July - planned update to new browser releases - tag: 3.1
2026 January - planned update to new browser release (update 4) - tag: 4.0

That's all. Goodbye for now.
